# Research Themes

## 1. Selective Inference 

Roughly speaking, this covers severe complications that can arise when you use the data that you're analyzing to decide on the details of your data analysis. For example, a researcher might explore their data using statistical machine learning in order to generate interesting hypotheses, and then test those hypotheses using the same data. Doing so grossly invalidates the properties of classical statistical hypothesis tests.

## 2. Inference × Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised machine learning learns relationships and structures from our data without the help of outputs: this includes clustering and dimension reduction. These methods are used to explore and understand our data, often with the ultimate goal of generating interesting insights for followup investigation. I'm interested in finding ways to test hypotheses about the structures and relationships we learn from our data, often within the framework of latent variable models.

## 3. Statistics × Optimization 

Optimization is used for everything in statistics - we use it to estimate, to predict, to infer, and to design. I enjoy learning from and working closely with colleagues in optimization to apply optimization theory and algorithms for statistical tasks. This interest has served me especially well in the area of optimal experiment design, where we think about how we should choose our experimental inputs in order to get as much information out of our experiment as possible. It also comes up in the context of some statistical machine learning problems I have worked on.
