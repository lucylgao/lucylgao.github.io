## About Me 
I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics at the University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/). My PhD in [Biostatistics from the University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) was supervised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). 

My research involves developing:

1. Statistical methods to answer scientific questions using complex data sets in the biomedical sciences using statistical machine learning and selective inference.

2. Statistical theory and methodology for the optimal design of research studies, often with collaborators in mathematical optimization.
