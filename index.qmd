## About Me 
I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics at the University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/). My PhD in [Biostatistics from the University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) was supervised by [Daniela Witten](https://www.danielawitten.com/). 

I am broadly interested in developing: 

1. Statistical methods at the intersection of biostatistics and statistical learning, and 

2. Statistical theory and methodology for the optimal design of research studies.

I am open to collaborations with domain scientists; historically, I have been primarily motivated by problems in biology, public health, and medicine, but I am always enthusiastic about discussing interesting scientific problems in other areas!
