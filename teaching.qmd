# Teaching

I am the instructor for **STAT 545** in 2022W1: a graduate course that teaches students how to write a clean and modern data analysis.  You can find out more about STAT 545 by visiting [the course website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/). 

I may have available **STAT 548** qualifying projects: see [this page](STAT548.qmd).

# Letters of recommendation 

## If I have not already agreed to write you a letter: 

I frequently get requests for letters of recommendation. Unless we regularly interacted, it is very unlikely that I can provide a strong letter. (I also do not have the bandwidth to make up a lack of interaction at the time you ask for your reference letter.) If we did not regularly interact but you achieved top scores in my class, then I can provide a lukewarm or moderately strong "took a class with me" letter, but I recommend that you make sure your application also includes a strong letter from someone else.

Letters need to be requested at least **two months** before your first application deadline. 

## If I have already agreed to write you a letter: 

I  need **a single email** from you at least **two** weeks notice before the first deadline containing the following information: 

- Basic logistical information: 

  - What name do you prefer for the letter (so that I don't use Sue for Suzanne or vice-versa)? 
  - Which pronouns (eg she/her, he/him, they/them) do you prefer?

- A list of all positions to which you are applying along with deadlines for each. 

- A recent CV or resume and an unofficial transcript. 

- Answers to the following questions: 

  - For what class(es) have I been your instructor for and how did you distinguish yourself in those class(es)? (Please note that if I have already agreed to write you a letter, then that means you have excellent test scores etc, and *that information will already be in your letter*.) Did we have any notable interactions I should highlight? 

  -  What makes me *particularly* qualified to write a letter for you?

  
If it is 2-3 days before my letter is due and I have yet to upload it, then please send me a **reminder email**. These types of reminder emails are not a burden to me at all. I would feel terrible if your application were to be thrown out because I failed to upload, so let's work together to make sure that doesn't happen.
